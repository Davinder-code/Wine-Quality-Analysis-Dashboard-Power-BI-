## Wine Quality Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project explores how different chemical properties influence the quality ratings of red and white wines. 
Using Power BI, I transformed raw wine data into a structured, interactive dashboard that highlights meaningful patterns, trends, and comparisons. 
The goal was to understand what makes a high-quality wine and how red and white wines differ chemically.

## Purpose

I created this project to practice real-world data analysis and visualization techniques. 
Wine chemistry is a complex dataset, and analyzing it allowed me to apply skills in data cleaning, feature exploration, and designing dashboards that clearly communicate insights. 
This type of analysis aligns with industry roles in food and beverage analytics, such as quality control and R&D.

## Dataset

The dataset includes two separate wine types, red and white. 
Each sample contains chemical attributes such as alcohol percentage, acidity levels, chlorides, sulfur dioxide, residual sugar, density, pH, sulphates, and a quality rating. 
These attributes help determine how each factor contributes to the final quality score.

## What the Dashboard Shows

The dashboard is organized to progressively tell the story of how wine quality is shaped by chemistry.

# Color Distribution

A comparison of total red versus white wine samples shows that white wine makes up the majority of the dataset. 
This helps establish context for all other comparisons.

# Alcohol and Quality

The analysis shows how increasing alcohol levels relate to rising average quality scores.
This is one of the strongest relationships in the dataset.

# Chemical Factors and Their Impact

Charts examining chlorides, fixed acidity, pH, sulphates, sulfur dioxide, and density reveal how each component influences wine quality. 
These visuals show differences between red and white wines and illustrate how chemical balance affects flavor, stability, and overall rating.

# Scatter Plots for Deeper Exploration

Scatter plots of citric acid, pH, and residual sugar help visualize the spread of values and reveal clustering patterns across different quality levels.

# Red vs White Quality Comparison

A side-by-side comparison of total quality scores highlights how each wine type performs overall 
and supports the storytelling of how chemical properties differ between red and white.

# Tools and Techniques

The project was built entirely in Power BI using Power Query for data preparation and DAX for calculations. 
Each visual was designed to provide a clear analytical perspective and support the narrative of how wine chemistry affects quality.

# What I Learned

This project helped me practice pattern recognition, build cleaner data models, and design dashboards that communicate insights without overwhelming the viewer. 
It strengthened my ability to transform raw data into a structured story, which is essential in data analytics roles.
